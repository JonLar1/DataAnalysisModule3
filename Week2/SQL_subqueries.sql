-- =========================================================
-- SUBQUERIES & NESTED LOGIC PRACTICE
-- =========================================================

-- Q1) Scalar subquery (AVG benchmark):
--     List products priced above the overall average product price.
--     Return product_id, name, price.
SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM products
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);

-- Q2) Scalar subquery (MAX within category):
--     Find the most expensive product(s) in the 'Beans' category.
--     (Return all ties if more than one product shares the max price.)
--     Return product_id, name, price.
SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM products
WHERE category_id = (SELECT category_id FROM categories WHERE name = 'Beans')
  AND price = (
    SELECT MAX(price) 
    FROM products 
    WHERE category_id = (SELECT category_id FROM categories WHERE name = 'Beans')
  );


-- Q3) List subquery (IN with nested lookup):
--     List customers who have purchased at least one product in the 'Merch' category.
--     Return customer_id, first_name, last_name.
--     Hint: Use a subquery to find the category_id for 'Merch', then a subquery to find product_ids.
SELECT DISTINCT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
WHERE oi.product_id IN (
  SELECT product_id 
  FROM products 
  WHERE category_id = (SELECT category_id FROM categories WHERE name = 'Merch')
);


-- Q4) List subquery (NOT IN / anti-join logic):
--     List products that have never been ordered (their product_id never appears in order_items).
--     Return product_id, name, price.
SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM products
WHERE product_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM order_items);


-- Q5) Table subquery (derived table + compare to overall average):
--     Build a derived table that computes total_units_sold per product
--     (SUM(order_items.quantity) grouped by product_id).
--     Then return only products whose total_units_sold is greater than the
--     average total_units_sold across all products.
--     Return product_id, product_name, total_units_sold.
SELECT product_id, product_name, total_units_sold
FROM (
  SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    p.name AS product_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_units_sold
  FROM products p
  JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
  GROUP BY p.product_id, p.name
) AS product_sales
WHERE total_units_sold > (
  SELECT AVG(total_units_sold)
  FROM (
    SELECT SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_units_sold
    FROM products p
    JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
    GROUP BY p.product_id
  ) AS avg_calc
);
